    <section class="overview">
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>Epimetheus is a Clinical Decision Support System designed and developed by
          <a href="https://mudilab.disco.unimib.it/" target="_blank">MUDI Lab</a>
          (Research Lab at Universit√† degli Studi Milano Bicocca). <br>
          It implements Machine Learning models to provide predictions on the outcomes
          of orthopedic surgical procedures, particularly regarding patient recovery,
          thereby assisting the doctors in the clinical decision-making process. <br>
          Specifically, the support aims to highlight a very delicate aspect of the decision-making journey,
          which is the representation of uncertainty.</p>

    <section class="features">
      <h3>Key Features:</h3>
      <p><strong>Epimetheus is a Clinical Decision Support System:</strong> it helps the communication between doctor and patient.</p>
      <p><strong>Epimetheus uses Machine Learning Models:</strong> these components calculate predictions on the outcomes of operations, based on data inserted by the user in a form.</p>
      <p><strong>Visualization of uncertainty:</strong> the results of the predictions are shown through the use of clear and intuitive diagrams.</p>
      <p><strong>Epimetheus is a Web App:</strong> it provides users with simple and intuitive access via a web browser.</p>

    <section class="solutions">
      <h3>Solutions Implemented:</h3>
        <h4>Two-tier architecture</h4>
      <p>Separating front-end from back-end let us develop and test UI and back-end as separate entities;
          it also assures greater scalability, modularity and enhances flexibility in development for future modifications.</p>
      <p>The front-end part consists of a React application, while the back-end is a Flask server implementing a RESTful API;
          specific endpoints were created for the front-end and back-end to communicate and exchange data.</p>

      <h4>User Interface</h4>
      <p>The interface consists of two pages: on the first page, the data entry form is presented,
          where the doctor inputs the patient's information. <br>
          Once all fields are filled out, the user, by clicking a button, initiates the prediction calculation. <br>
          If there are no errors, they land on the results page, where they can view data visualizations;
          there are four different visualization diagrams.</p>

        <img src="/static/images/epimetheus-ui2.png" alt="UI Image">

      <h4>Application Deployment</h4>
      <p>The application was deployed using an Apache Server configured on a computer with a public IP Address. <br>
          This choice ensures complete control over the hosting environment and server configuration
          and gives us the capability to handle high volumes of traffic while maintaining high performance.</p>

    <section class="results">
      <h3>Results, Impact, and Future Enhancements:</h3>
      <p>Epimetheus is a software designed to directly aid in clinical decision-making:
          the characteristics of individual patients are compared with a computerized clinical knowledge base,
          and patient situations or recommendations are presented to the doctor for a decision.</p>
      <p>In the context of technological evolution and the growing importance of data in the healthcare sector,
          applications like Epimetheus represent a valuable resource for improving the quality of medical care
          and optimizing clinical decision-making processes. They simplify doctor-patient communication,
          promote data understanding, and facilitate calculation and prediction, even when dealing with large
          quantities of data and high complexity.</p>
      <p>Testing the application in a real environment and receiving feedback from users will highlight
          the strengths and weaknesses of the application, fostering continuous and iterative development of the system. <br>
          Moreover, demonstrating its utility and reliability in the clinical context would encourage healthcare providers
          to use it and integrate it into their practice.</p>
